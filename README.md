# Petz Vite + React app

This React projects consumes a RESTful API created using Ruby On Rails. You can find this API [here](https://github.com/cvaldivia83/rails-petz-api). 
The API supports interactions with five core tables: **Feed**, **Post**, **Comments**, **Likes**, and **User**. These resources allow users to create, read, update, and delete posts and comments, like posts, and manage user authentication. The API integrates with this Vite front-end, which provides the user interface for the social media experience.
